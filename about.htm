                Oxford Flying Club, formed in 1992, is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to safe,
                affordable flying for its members. We are based at Waterbury-Oxford Airport (OXC),
                a modern, well-managed state-owned facility in Oxford, Connecticut. Thanks to a
                diverse, involved membership the Club has become one of the most active aviation
                organizations in New England.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oxford Flying Club is a friendly group of about 70 individuals who share the joy
                of aviation. Our membership encompasses pilots of all experience levels from basic 
                students to retired airline pilots, and includes several instructors who offer
                expert training and guidance.                
                Each member contributes his or her talents to keep the Club and the
                Aircraft running smoothly. Members are known to fly together to share experience,
                cross train, and maintain currency. We offer aviation camaraderie, education and
                fun!

                Tuesday of each month. Although Club Business and Safety Discussions are the
